Well this [Octopage](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/octopage-blogging-jekyll-markdown/id649843345 "OctoPage on Appstore") app seems to be exactly what i was looking for, except <del>for the lack of spellcheck and</del> that it isn't free :3 I'm now able easily post from my iphone.

Worth looking if there's something like dropbox/flickr/etc that I can use to host images on to link into posts, or if I can use one of these github clients to upload images to the repo. Something fast and easy would be ideal.

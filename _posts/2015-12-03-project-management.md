I realize that as I try to push and maximize the amount I can get done in a day,  the productivity tools I rely on personally, currently cause trouble when not adopted. We all have our preferences and needs, so I need to improve the ability of my existing workflow. 

For now I'll attempt to better track required interactions and *next actions*, as I'm finding the same of communications issues that cause inefficiencies in business apply to school projects. A reliable approach has been transparency, and accountability.

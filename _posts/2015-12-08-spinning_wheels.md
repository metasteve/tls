Sometimes a potential gig is just too tempting, so you throw caution out the door and make time to hammer out something you wouldn't normally do; but then you've got it sorted and the client decides they need to you convince them it's still a good idea.

I learned a lot more about [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/ "Meteor Website") and [ES6](http://es6-features.org/ "New Features in ES6") (the new version of JavaScript) this weekend, and got a much better understanding of how I'll be able to integrate WAI-ARIA into real-time applications like this.

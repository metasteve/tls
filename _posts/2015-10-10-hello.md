Markdown is really, great PEANUTS but i'll have to look more at the templating to see where i add ARIA and semantics stuff, a lot of the formatting is above, and then there's the css possibly?

^ this is now a lot more obvious as the platform starts to actually work :) this should be a perfect way to implement what I want, and then I'll be able to make posts from Drafts (ios), etc.

## Blargh. Wait, no actually, Wooo!

Initially was going to complain about how I'd spent all this time working on adding the fluid prefs panel to the site, and had it working well in it's demo sub directory, but it blew up when I moved it out. Midway through typing that I thought about how it much only be one file, and then about how it had to be one of the js files because of the error that was being thrown up, so then surely it must have been one of the ones in the folder that was moved with the index, and low and behold there were a few ../../ links in that file as well, oops! :3

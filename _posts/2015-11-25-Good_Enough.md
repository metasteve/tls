This finally seems to be in a half usable state. Certainly I want to get the postdata access going so I can set specifics like the background colour of the post in site listtings, but this may not be necesary. i could randomize them?

I'll move to: 
- actually styling this properly
- adding some integrations starting to explore making the site more dynamic
- some documentation to help with onboarding
- break out layouts a bit more to make them more illustrative
  - maybe based on ARIA-landmarks?

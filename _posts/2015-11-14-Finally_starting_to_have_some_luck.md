There were a lot of silly mistakes and errors that were making me doubt the overall flow, but they've all been ironed out and I'm finally starting to get some progress. Seemed like a good time to make a journal entry, and it's pretty satisfying to be starting to use the project as it starts to get rolling. This has also taught me deeper functionality in the github interface itself.

Considering this project, there are tradeoffs vs just doing a basic HTML page in a folder.

### pros
- easier to make posts
- introduction to github
- automatic backup
- worldclass, free hosting


### cons
- additional complexity
